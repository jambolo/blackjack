# BlackJack Analysis

Tools for the analysis of BlackJack, written in Julia.

## Executables

### generate-card-density-by-count.jl
Dealing each card from a 6-deck shoe up to the penetration limit is simulated 10,000,000 times. For each count, the
average density of each card (1-13) in the remaining shoe is computed. Results are written to the file
`data/cardDensitiesByCount.json`. A summary is written to the console.

### generate-next-card-outcome-distribution.jl
Computes the probabilities of each outcome for each possible hand after taking one card. Hands with a score of 6 through 10 treat and Ace as 11, while the rest treat it as a 1. Specific card combinations are not considered. The shoe is assumed to have an infinite number of decks.

## Summaries
Summaries of analysis results.

### Average distribution of low (2-6), uncounted(7-9), and high cards (A,10-K) for each count
After dealing 4.5 decks from a 6-deck shoe for 10,000,000 shoes.
